DELTA = 136, INITIAL GUESS = 0:

Black it. deepening vs White asp. search -> Black won (it. deepening)

re-searches at depth = 4, 5, 6, 7





DELTA = 171, INITIAL_GUESS = previous turn's root evaluation

Black it. deepening vs white asp. search -> White won (asp search)






DELTA = 100, guess odd-even effect compensation:

Black it. deepening vs white asp. search -> White won (asp search)

Black asp. search vs White it. deepening -> White won (it. deepening)

some times re-searches at depth = 1 or 2, and at 8 or 9 when win proven.
