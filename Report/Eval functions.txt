Normal = material + progression
Enhanced = material + progression + controlled progression

DEPTH 7 (35/1 vs 35)
Black normal vs White Enhanced -> White wins	(Enhanced)
Black Enhanced vs White normal -> Black wins	(Enhanced)

DEPTH 7 (35/35 vs 35)
Black normal vs White Enhanced -> White wins	(Enhanced)
Black Enhanced vs White normal -> Black wins	(Enhanced)

DEPTH 6 (35/1) vs DEPTH 7 (35)
Black normal vs White Enhanced -> Black wins	(Normal)
Black Enhanced vs White normal -> Black wins	(Enhanced)

DEPTH 6 (35/35) vs DEPTH 7 (35)
Black normal vs White Enhanced -> Black wins	(Normal)
Black Enhanced vs White normal -> White wins	(Normal)



CONCLUSIONS:
At equal depth, Enhanced always beats normal
At lower depth, Black Enhanced can still beat White normal with weights 35/1. White Enhanced cannot beat Black normal with any weights, and Black Enhanced also cannot beat White normal with weights 35/35

So use Enhanced with weights 35/1
